Work Experience
Klaviyo  Software Engineering Intern							            		              June 2025 - August 2025
Owned the end-to-end lifecycle of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server extension, deploying a dynamic prompt template feature to the product
Replaced simple API wrappers with a threaded, cached orchestration layer to chain complex data retrievals; implemented metadata filtering to provide dense, semantic context for improved LLM grounding
Built a technical prototype for semantic documentation search and a prompt management system to replace hardcoded templates; delivered the design docs and codebase for the product roadmap
Developed push notification analytic metrics used by 400+ companies (Python, React), integrating push metrics such as bounce and click rates into existing reporting infrastructure; utilized ReactQuery for optimized caching to support the generation of 5,000+ push metric reports in under two weeks

Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval  Researcher						       	        September 2024 - June 2025
Second author on RaDeR (EMNLP ‘25); contributed to experiment design for synthetic data generation, co-authored paper sections, and implemented training pipelines and baseline retrieval systems
Fine-tuned novel dense retrieval models on A100 GPU clusters using DeepSpeed, achieving state-of-the-art results on the BRIGHT benchmark
Boosted data throughput by 15x for LLM post-training by designing a three-tier parallel pipeline: utilized Python multiprocessing for LLM-guided tree traversal, threaded I/O for vLLM server requests, and model parallelism across A100 GPUs

X-Camp Academy  Software Engineering Intern								              June 2024 - August 2024
Implemented cookie-based session management for a prototype chatbot, maintaining persistent state and conversation context across sessions; supported frontend and backend development across the product (Flask, React)
Automated the conversion of 90,000+ student submissions into an embedding index and integrated it into a FAISS-backed dense retrieval system for a prototype coding tutor agent, improving LLM-judged response quality by 42%

Lockheed Martin Space  Software Engineering Intern						             	   Summer 2022 & Summer 2023
Developed performance-critical C++ data interfaces for the LM 50 & 400 satellites, enabling real-time communication between satellite components
Built serialization and validation routines for satellite telemetry data, ensuring reliable, low-latency delivery of sensor readings under strict memory constraints
Engineered a reusable C++ class to manage asynchronous packet processing, overcoming a custom OS limitation that previously restricted messaging to one callback at a time; utilized mutexes and locks to ensure thread safety in a memory-constrained environment

Projects 
CLIP Image and Text Embedding Pipeline and Inference System  (Python, FastAPI, Pinecone)
Built an end-to-end ML inference API for CLIP embeddings using FastAPI; implemented adaptive batching with a queue-and-timeout mechanism to maximize GPU utilization; indexed 100k images in Pinecone for similarity search

Poker Agent  (Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace)
Engineered a deep reinforcement learning agent for Texas Hold'em, leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a custom deep learning policy network to learn decision-making under uncertainty; secured 7th place in a 22-team tournament

Deep Reinforcement Learning: Advantage Actor Critic  (PyTorch, Gym)
Implemented Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) with generalized advantage estimation from scratch in PyTorch; trained on OpenAI Gymnasium environments (Lunar Lander, Cart Pole) to validate convergence and policy stability
