# Sam's Personal Website

## What is this?
This repository contains the source code for Sam's personal website. The website is built using a React frontend and Next.js. It showcases my portfolio, technologies I work with, and contact information.

## Why did I build this?
It is mainly inteded to demonstrate my skills as a software engineer and provide a platform for potential employers or collaborators to learn more about me. Since I am a software engineer, the design
and user experience should reflect my technical expertise. A viewer of this website should come away with a positive impression of my skills and capabilities, and impressed with the demos and actual website they see.

## How to work with this code?
This is a standard Next.js project. To run it locally, just use npm run dev and manage dependencies with npm. This is a low traffic site and it really isnt that big a deal if it crashes or is not optimized. It will automatically run on localhost:3000 by default, and pushing to main will deploy on Vercel.

When making changes,
Make sure to make incremental commits. No need to test with unit or integration tests at all, just make sure the site works when you run it locally with the help of me poking around the local version.

## Using Memories
Within the AGENT_WORKSPACE/AGENT_MEMORY folder, you may find markdown files that contain valuable insights and learnings from previous tasks. These memories are intended to help you understand the codebase better and provide guidance on best practices.

When working on a new task, consider reviewing relevant memories to see if they can assist you in your work.

## Creating Memories
I have created a folder called AGENT_WORKSPACE/AGENT_MEMORY inside the project directory. Once you are done with a task, reflect on what you learned from it. Document any new insights, techniques, or knowledge you gained during the process. This will help you build a repository of learnings that you can refer back to in the future. Specifically focus on helpful commands learned, testing frameworks and strategies, debugging techniques, in depth information about how the repo actually works, and any other relevant information that could be useful for future reference. Keep it to only the most important and relevant information to avoid clutter, and update existing entries as you gain more knowledge. 

 Think like a senior engineer that is creating notes for themselves and any future engineers that will have to work on this code. These are brief notes and not full documentation, more like a helpful add on for existing in depth documentation. This is a meta-learning task, meaning you are using these notes to help you learn how best to learn in the future.

 MEMORIES SHOULD NOT JUST BE A LOG OF WHAT YOU DID, BUT RATHER GENERAL REASONING, INSIGHTS AND INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP YOU AND OTHERS IN THE FUTURE.

 Memories should be stored as markdown files, each with its own topic. Use existing files if possible.
